      <p>
        Welcome to our community! To ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for
        everyone, we have a few guidelines that we ask all members to follow:
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-base font-bold mt-4">1. Be Respectful</h2>
      <p>
        Treat all members with respect and kindness. Harassment, hate speech,
        and discriminatory behavior will not be tolerated.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-base font-bold mt-4">2. Keep it Friendly</h2>
      <p>
        Engage in conversations and discussions in a friendly and constructive
        manner. Avoid personal attacks and aggressive behavior.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-base font-bold mt-4">3. Stay on Topic</h2>
      <p>
        Keep your discussions relevant to the community's focus. Off-topic posts
        and spam are discouraged.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-base font-bold mt-4">4. Respect Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Respect the privacy of fellow members. Do not share personal information
        without consent.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-base font-bold mt-4">5. Follow Applicable Laws</h2>
      <p>
        Ensure that your interactions and content comply with applicable laws
        and regulations.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-base font-bold mt-4">6. Report Violations</h2>
      <p>
        If you come across any content or behavior that violates these
        guidelines, please report it to the community administrators.
      </p>
